# Babycatcher
Finding the right midwife can be a tricky process if you don't know where to look or who to ask for a referral.  Babycatcher is the first-ever app specifically designed to connect pregnant people with Midwives who provide home birth services in their county. 

Individuals can register, create a profile, and log in to their own profile page.  Logging in enables the user to view the directory, filter by county, view Midwife profiles and save Midwives to their collection of favorites.  Once a Midwife is saved in a User's collection, the user can send an SMS directly to the Midwife.  Midwives are also able to register, create a profile and log in to their own profile page, from there they can view their public profile as well as view or search the directory.

## About the Developer
A former midwife herself, Melissa Rauch is now a software engineering fellow at HackBright Academy.  Despite truly enjoying her work as a midwife, she made a bold career change in pursuit of a better work-life balance. After hanging up her stethoscope, she caught a glimpse of the world of software engineering during her time as an Executive Assistant to the CEO at a neuro-tech company in San Francisco.  She may be one of the only midwife-turned-developer youâ€™ll ever meet, but her experience as a midwife has taught her skills that are key to being an engineer.  Her ability to handle high-stress situations with grace and her comfortability in navigating uncertain and at times ambiguous environments and situations transfer as an asset to any engineering team.
