## About the Developer
---
Former midwife, Melissa Rauch is now a software engineering fellow at HackBright Academy.  Despite truly enjoying her work as a midwife, she made a bold career change in pursuit of a better work-life balance. After hanging up her stethoscope, she caught a glimpse of the world of software engineering during her time as an Executive Assistant to the CEO at a neuro-tech company in the Bay Area.  She may be one of the only midwife-turned-developer youâ€™ll ever meet, but her experience as a midwife has taught her skills that are key to being an engineer.  Her ability to handle high-stress situations with grace and her comfortability in navigating uncertain and at times ambiguous environments and situations transfer as an asset to any engineering team.
